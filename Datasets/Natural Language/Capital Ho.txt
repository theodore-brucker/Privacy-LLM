Capital Hotel is a small 5-star hotel in London, England. It is located at 22–24 Basil Street,  Knightsbridge, and is known to have been visited by The Queen.[1]

It was established by David Levin in April 1971.[2]

The Capital Hotel is a townhouse hotel with 49 individually designed rooms. It features the work of designers such as Nina Campbell and David Linley.[3] The Capital is known for its classic English style, and has eight suites and a two floor penthouse.[citation needed]

In 1974 the hotel's restaurant, The Capital Restaurant, was one of the first three hotel restaurants in London to achieve a Michelin Star under chefs Richard Shepherd and Brian Turner.[4] In 2001 it earned a second star under Éric Chavot.[5] Other notable chefs who have worked there include Gary Rhodes and Paul Merrett.[6]   The restaurant lost its stars after Chavot's departure in 2009.[7]

By 2013, the hotel's restaurant had been replaced by a new restaurant, Outlaw's at The Capital, the only London restaurant of seafood chef Nathan Outlaw.[8] Outlaw's at The Capital has one Michelin star.[citation needed]
