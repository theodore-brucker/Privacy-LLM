The Republic of Guatemala is divided into 22 departments (Spanish: departamentos)[1]
which in turn are divided into 340 municipalities.[2][3] The departments are governed by a departmental governor, appointed by the President.

In addition, Guatemala has claimed that all or part of the nation of Belize is a department of Guatemala, and this claim is sometimes reflected in maps of the region. Guatemala formally recognized Belize in 1991, but the border disputes between the two nations have not been resolved.[4][5]
