The UK Rapid Test Consortium (UK-RTC) is a United Kingdom industry consortium created to produce a lateral flow rapid test for COVID-19. Rapid tests are a form of COVID-19 testing technology that was originally developed from significant investment by the United Kingdom government to develop new forms of COVID-19 testing that provided advantages over existing forms such as PCR. Its members include Abingdon Health, BBI Solutions, CIGA Healthcare, Omega Diagnostics, and Oxford University.[1][2]

In 2020, the consortium developed the AbC-19 rapid antibody test to meet UK government requirements.[2] The government ordered 1 million of the UK-RTC's rapid tests in October 2020.[3]

CIGA Healthcare was made responsible for assembly and distribution, and was awarded distribution to the United States in November 2020 after approval was given by the FDA.[4]
