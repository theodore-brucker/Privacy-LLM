The Maharashtra Legislative Assembly (IAST: Mahārāṣhṭra Vidhāna Sabhā) is the lower house of the legislature of the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is situated in the Nariman Point area of South Mumbai in the capital Mumbai. Presently, 288 members of the Legislative Assembly are directly elected from the single-seat constituencies.
