McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.S. 618 (1978), was a United States Supreme Court case that struck down the last remaining state restriction against religious ministers holding elected office.

Paul A. McDaniel was a Baptist minister in Chattanooga, Tennessee who gained prominence in his lifetime as an activist within the community.[1][2] He filed as a candidate to be a delegate to the 1977 Tennessee State Constitutional Convention. His opponent, Selma Cash Paty, successfully challenged his candidacy based on a state law that forbade ordained ministers from elected office.

In an 8–0 decision, the court ruled that the state law violated both the First and Fourteenth Amendments. A modified version of the statute, prohibiting "ministers of the Gospel" from serving in the Tennessee legislature, remains as Article IX, Section 1. of the Tennessee State Constitution.[3]

The Tennessee Constitutional Amendment 4, or the Remove Religious Minister Disqualification Amendment, was proposed as a measure on the November 2022 ballot to remove this restriction.[4] In accordance with state constitutional law, the proposed amendment was submitted to the state legislature in both the 2019–2020 and 2021–2022 sessions. The measure was ratified by the voters.[5]
