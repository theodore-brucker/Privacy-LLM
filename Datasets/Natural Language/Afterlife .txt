The song was released on September 19, 2019. It serves as a single from the soundtrack of the Apple TV series Dickinson, which also stars Steinfeld as renowned poet Emily Dickinson. Steinfeld announced the song via her social media accounts on September 14, 2019.[7][non-primary source needed]

"This record has become one of my favorite songs I’ve worked on and sonically, it’s indicative of the direction I’m exploring with my new music. There’s a line in the song that says ‘immortality is bliss’ and its reminiscent of a lot of Emily’s poems, She lived during a time where women were forbidden from voicing their opinions and restricted in many ways, including how they dressed. I wanted the single art to reflect this idea too so the corset has an exaggerated cinch to represent how Emily in particular felt constricted and stifled."
The Hannah Lux Davis-directed music video premiered on Steinfeld's YouTube channel on September 30, 2019, via YouTube premiere.[9] Another video titled "For Your Consideration", featuring the cast of Dickinson and creator Alena Smith, was released on July 1, 2020.[10]
