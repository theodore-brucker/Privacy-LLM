The Florida orange juice boycott from 1977 to 1980 was an LGBT protest against the anti-gay activism of Anita Bryant and the Save Our Children campaign. The boycott lasted from January 1977 until Bryant's firing from the Florida Citrus Commission in 1980.

On June 7, 1977, Anita Bryant and her campaign successfully repealed Miami's anti-discrimination ordinance in a referendum won by a margin of 69 to 31 percent. However, the gay community retaliated against her by forming the Coalition for Human Rights and the Miami Victory Campaign. At the time, Bryant was most famous for her advertising jingle for orange juice companies.[2]

The Coalition for Human Rights and the Miami Victory Campaign organized a boycott of orange juice in opposition to Bryant and her campaign.[3] Gay bars all over North America stopped serving screwdrivers[4] and replaced them with the "Anita Bryant Cocktail", which was made with vodka and apple juice.[5] Additionally, merchandise such as buttons, bumper stickers, and T-shirts with slogans like "A day without human rights is like a day without sunshine" were sold to push the anti-discrimination movement further. Sales and proceeds went to gay rights activists to help fund their fight against Bryant and her campaign.[5]

In San Francisco, the San Francisco Tavern Guild distributed signs that read, "To promote human rights, this establishment does not serve Florida orange juice or orange juice from concentrate."[6] According to historian Emily S. Johnson, the boycott brought together LGBT rights activists across the country who could "boycott Florida orange juice in a show of solidarity."[6]

The Florida Citrus Commission publicly supported Bryant; however, the company's publicity director told the Associated Press, "The whole Anita thing is a mess. No matter what we decide, we're only going to lose. I wish she would just resign."[7] The boycott was supported by celebrities, including Jane Fonda, Paul Williams, and Vincent Price, who joked in a television interview that Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance referred to her.[5][8][9]

In 1980, the commission canceled Bryant's 10-year contract after a public and acrimonious divorce, though Bryant claimed she had been "blacklist."[6][7]
