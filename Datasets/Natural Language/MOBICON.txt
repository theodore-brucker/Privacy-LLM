MOBICON is an annual fan convention held in Mobile, AL. Named for an earlier convention known formally as the Mobile Comic Art and Science Fiction Festival,[1] MOBICON was re-founded in 1998 and its membership has steadily grown since its inception. MOBICON is a multigenre convention with a broad focus on many aspects of popular culture, fandom including science fiction, fantasy, gaming, movies, anime, horror, art, and comics.

Every year actors, authors, artists and their fans come from all over the world to interact with each other and participate in unique events pertaining to their favorite obsession.  A portion of MOBICON's proceeds benefit a charity that is chosen each year by its Board of Directors.

Members of MOBICON can participate in many unique fan themed events including discussion panels, charity auctions, a dealers room, an art show and auction, promotional events, video rooms, a film festival, a fan-sponsored dance, 24-hour gaming, and costume contests.[2][3] Select events, such as the costume contest, are structured so that fans with varying skill levels may participate. The convention also features a "con suite" lounge area with refreshments for members and staff.[4]

All attendees of MOBICON are not ticket-holders but rather pay to become members of the non-profit organization hosting the convention.[4] As such, all members are encouraged to attend meetings, join committees and elect committee heads.  As a not-for profit organization, MOBICON is organized and run by volunteers.[2][3]

MOBICON's board of directors choose a charity each year to benefit from fundraising efforts at that year's convention.[2] Over half of MOBICON's proceeds benefit the chosen charity every year.  Over the years, these charities have included the Make a Wish Foundation, the Bay Area Food Bank, and the Mobile SPCA.[3][5]  MOBICON's parent organization, Mobicon Inc., is itself a Federally-recognized not-for-profit tax-exempt entity under 501(a) and 501(c)(4).[2]
