The Gulf of Khambhat, historically known as the Gulf of Cambay, is a bay on the Arabian Sea coast of India, bordering the state of Gujarat just north of Mumbai and Diu Island.[1] The Gulf of Khambhat is about 200 km (120 mi) long, about 20 km (12 mi) wide in the north and up to 70 km (43 mi) wide in the south. Major rivers draining Gujarat are the Narmada, Tapti, Mahi and the Sabarmati, that form estuaries in the gulf.[2]

It divides the Kathiawar Peninsula from the south-eastern part of Gujarat.[3][4][5]

There are plans to construct a 30-kilometre (19 mi) dam, Kalpasar Project, across the gulf.[6]

To the west of the Gulf, Asiatic lions inhabit the Gir Forest National Park and its surroundings, the region of Kathiawar or Saurashtra.[3][7] To the east of the Gulf, the Dangs' Forest and Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, where Gujarat meets Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, used to host Bengal tigers.[8]
