Ex Libris Group is an Israeli software company that develops integrated library systems and other library software. The company is headquartered in Jerusalem, and has ten other offices around the world.[1] In October 2015, Ex Libris was acquired by ProQuest[2] which in turn was acquired by Clarivate in December 2021.

Ex Libris started as an internal project at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1980 to develop a new library management system, as no system at the time was able to handle both Hebrew and Latin character sets as required by the university. The software was called Automated Library Expandable Program or ALEPH-100 ("Aleph" is also the name of the first letter of many Semitic alphabets).[3] In 1983, Yissum (the technology transfer company of the Hebrew University) founded Aleph-Yissum Ltd., a new company to commercialize the software. Yohanan Spruch, the original developer of ALEPH, became the company's chief technology officer. Between 1983 and 1988, all eight Israeli universities bought the program and linked up in a network.[3]

In 1986 Ex Libris Ltd. was founded by technology entrepreneur Azriel Morag to market the software overseas.  In 1993, ALEPH was deployed by the seventeen libraries of the Vatican[4]
and 200 libraries in 27 countries had bought it by 1995.[3]

In 1995 Aleph-Yissum merged with Ex Libris Ltd. and reorganized as the Ex Libris Group, headed by Azriel Morag as the group's chief executive officer.[5]

In February 2018, Ex Libris partnered with five universities across the US to collaborate on the development of a new research services platform, Ex Libris Esploro. It was the company's first step into the research services market.[28] The company provides services to thousands of customers in more than 90 countries.[29] As of 2015, Ex Libris served 43 of the 50 top universities in the world.[29] Over 40 national libraries use Ex Libris solutions.[30]
