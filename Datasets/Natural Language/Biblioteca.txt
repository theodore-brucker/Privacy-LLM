Biblioteca pentru toți (BPT, Library For All) is a Romanian collection that was initiated by the writer and folklorist Dumitru Stăncescu and published from March 1, 1895, by the publisher Carol Müller, who was inspired by the German pocket collection Reclams Universal-Bibliothek from Leipzig.[1][2]

The first issue from 1895 included "Selected stories" by Hans Christian Andersen, translated in Romanian by Dumitru Stăncescu. 178 numbers were published. In 1900 the collection was sold to the Leon Alcalay Bookstore, Bucharest, which continued the numbering from 179.

From 1920, the collection came under the auspices of the "Viata Românească" publishing house, which continues to publish issues, and after 3 years reaches no. 1105.

In 1941, no volume was published. In 1942–1949, the collection was published by Socec Publishing House (Editura Socec).

From 1950 to 1959 it was published by Editura Cartea Rusă and Editura pentru Literatură și Artă, without collection numbers. Since 1960, again numbered from 1, the collection has been edited by Editura de Stat pentru Literatură și Artă (ESPLA); Editura pentru Literatură (EPL) and, from 1970 to 2001, by Editura Minerva.[5]
