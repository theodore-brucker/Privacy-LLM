The following is a partial list of minor planets, running from minor-planet number 152001 through 153000, inclusive. The primary data for this and other partial lists is based on JPL's "Small-Body Orbital Elements"[1] and "Data Available from the Minor Planet Center".[2] A detailed description of the table's columns and additional sources are given on the main page including a complete list of every page in this series, and a statistical break-up on the dynamical classification of minor planets.

Also see the summary list of all named bodies in numerical and alphabetical order, and the corresponding naming citations for the number range of this particular list. New namings may only be added to this list after official publication, as the preannouncement of names is condemned by the Working Group for Small Bodies Nomenclature of the International Astronomical Union.
