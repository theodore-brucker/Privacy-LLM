The Shwegugyi Temple (Burmese: ရွှေဂူကြီး ဘုရား, pronounced [ʃwèɡùdʑí pʰəjá]; literally, "Great Golden Cave") is a Theravadin Buddhist temple in Bagan, Myanmar. The temple is recognized as Monument #1589 in the Bagan Archeological Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[1]

Located just to the southeast of what apparently were the ruins of the former royal palace founded by King Kyansittha (r. 1084–1113),[1] the temple was built by King Sithu I of Pagan (Bagan) in 1131.[2] According to the stone inscriptions at the temple, set up in 1141,[3] construction work on the temple began on 17 May 1331, and was completed on 17 December 1331.[4] Built on an expansive 3 m (9.8 ft) tall brick foundation, the temple is known for its arched windows, and fine stucco and carved wooden doors in the interior.[1]
