Unsolicited advertisement comprise all of, but are not limited to:

for advertising and marketing purposes which are sent without request.[1]

Unsolicited advertising usually violates informational self-determination, when the addresses to which advertising material is delivered have not been explicitly communicated to the sender by the addressee, i.e. no opt-in was done.

The FCC defines "unsolicited advertisement" as:[citation needed]

any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services which is transmitted to any person without that personâ€™s prior express invitation or permission, in writing or otherwise.
Whereas traditional postal advertisements produce huge amounts of waste paper and plastic waste,[3] modern electronic forms consume bandwidth and data storage space.
Various methods exist for prevention of and defense against unsolicited advertisements, including opt-out from email lists, entry in blocking lists, like Robinson lists or the National Do Not Call Registry, etc.. Legislation has produced countermeasures like the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[4]
