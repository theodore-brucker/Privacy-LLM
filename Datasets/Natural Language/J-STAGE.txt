J-STAGE (Japan Science Technology Information Aggregator, Electronic) is an electronic journal platform for Japanese academic journals, administered by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).[1]
It "supports the submission of manuscripts, peer‐reviewing, page‐layouting and dissemination of electronic journals" published in Japan.[2]  The site provides free access to full text electronic journals, proceedings, and reports from various Japanese scientific societies.[3]

It includes the Journal@rchive, an open access digital archive of Japanese journals, established in 2005 by the Government of Japan.[4][5] By April 2009, some 540 academic organizations made use of the facility.[6] As of February 2012, 1.68 million articles were available for download.[7] To build the archive, in 2006 a robotic book scanner was introduced that could scan 1,200 pages per hour.[8]
