Spillover into Turkey

Operation Spring Shield (Turkish: Bahar Kalkanı Harekâtı) was a cross-border military operation carried out by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) in the Idlib Governorate of northwestern Syria against the Syrian Armed Forces and allied militias. The operation was launched on 27 February 2020 in direct response to the Balyun airstrikes, aiming to address the escalating situation in the region.[25][26]

According to Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, the primary objective of Operation Spring Shield was to achieve a ceasefire agreement within the framework of the Astana talks and to establish stability in the Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone. Additionally, the operation sought to prevent the mass migration of people from Idlib to the Turkish border, a pressing humanitarian concern.[27]

On 5 March, Turkey and Russia signed a ceasefire agreement in Moscow, marking a step towards de-escalation in the region.[4]

On 27 February 2020, during the Dawn of Idlib 2 Operation, Turkish Army positions in Balyun, Idlib Governorate, came under attack from airstrikes allegedly conducted by the Syrian Air Force and the Russian Air Force. Resulting in the deaths of 36 Turkish soldiers,[28][16] with a reported number of wounded ranging from 36 to 60.[29][30]

The following day, Russia denied it had carried out the airstrikes and stated that it had made efforts to halt the Syrian military's firing to facilitate the safe evacuation of the Turkish troops. Russia said that the Turkish forces should not have been present in the area, where "counter-terror operations" were underway, and criticized Turkey for failing to notify them about the soldiers' presence in advance. On the contrary, Turkey maintained that Russia was well aware of the locations of Turkish troops, as the two countries regularly communicated about this matter.[31]

Following the air attack in Balyun, Turkey officially launched its military intervention, initiating Operation Spring Shield. The primary objective of this operation was to put a stop to the Syrian government forces' advancement on Syrian rebels in Idlib and push them back to their pre-offensive positions.[32]

On 28th February, the Turkish Ministry of National Defense reported that the Turkish armed forces had responded to the airstrikes and claimed to have "neutralized" 329 Syrian troops. Additionally, they claimed to have successfully destroyed five helicopters, 23 tanks, 10 armored vehicles, 23 artillery and howitzers, one SA-17, and one SA-22 air defense systems belonging to the Syrian government.[33][34]

A Syrian military official acknowledged that their armored and technical vehicles had been heavily targeted, resulting in significant destruction of their arsenal in northwestern Syria.[35]

A Turkish soldier, 11 Syrian soldiers and four members of the Lebanese Hezbollah were killed during the day.[36][37]

On 29 February, Turkish airstrikes targeted the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center in As-Safira.[38] Which a Turkish official claimed was used to develop chemical weapons.[39]

On 1 March, two Syrian Su-24 jets were shot down by Turkish Air Force F-16s.[24] All four Syrian pilots safely ejected.

On 3 March, the Syrian Army captured the strategic city of Saraqib and several surrounding villages after pushing back rebel forces supported by Turkish artillery and air power.[48][49] The Turkish airstrikes on government targets reduced significantly amidst a further government advance toward the town of Afis.[50][51] Concurrently, a Syrian Air Force Aero L-39 Albatros was shot downed by a Turkish F-16 over Idlib, with conflicting reports over the pilots fate.[52][53] Meanwhile, a Turkish Bayraktar drone was shot down by the Syrian Army in the western Aleppo countryside.[54][55]

During the day, five Turkish soldiers were killed by Syrian bombardment in Taftanaz Airbase, Al-Tarnaba and Al-Mastouma camp.[56][57]

On 4 March, Turkish sources claimed that Suheil al-Hassan was wounded by a drone strike near Saraqib.[58] A Turkish Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by Syrian forces in the Idlib Governorate.[59][60]

During the day, 19 Syrian soldiers and seven non-Syrian fighters were killed by Turkish ground shelling and drones in Idlib countryside.[61]

On 5 March 2020, the presidents of Turkey and Russia, Erdoğan and Putin, met in Moscow for high-level talks.[62] According to the statements made by the Turkish and Russian leaders following their one-on-one meeting, a ceasefire in the area of Idlib was to come into force from 00:00 hrs on 6 March. The terms of the ceasefire included a secure corridor 6 kilometers either side of the M4 highway, to be patrolled jointly by Russia and Turkey beginning on 15 March.[63]

According to the Oryx blog, Syrian government equipment losses on the ground amounted to 50 tanks, 38 artilleries, 21 IFV's and 31 other vehicles.[64]

The Middle East Institute reported that Turkish drone and artillery strikes, alongside rebel fighters, killed at least 405 pro-regime fighters between February 27 and March 5. And that Damascus had also lost at least 73 armored vehicles to drone strikes and rebel anti-tank guided missile operators during the Turkish operation.[65]

Since the signing of the ceasefire in March 2020, the Syrian Air Force has not conducted any airstrikes within the de-escalation zone, and this status remains unchanged as of April 2023.[66]
