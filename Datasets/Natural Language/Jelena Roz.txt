During the ten years, the band released numerous commercially and critically successful singles including "Ginem", "Minut' srca tvog" and "Minus i plus" among others. 

In 2006, Rozga launched a solo career with the release of her debut studio album Oprosti Mala (English: Sorry Baby). The album was a major commercial and critical success that established her status as a solo artist. It peaked on top of the Croatian Albums Chart and produced several commercially successful singles, including "Gospe moja" (English: My Lady), "Oprosti mala" (English: Sorry Baby), and "Ne zovi me Marija" (English: Don't Call Me Marija).

She will embark on the regional Minut Srca Mog Tour (2022-23) in its promotion.

In addition to her singing career, Rozga also shortly ventured in acting and voiceovers. She is considered to be one of the most famous singers in Croatia, having received gold certifications for three solo albums and having won numerous awards, including the Grand Prix award at the Split Festival.[1] She has also enjoyed wider regional success and popularity in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Slovenia.

Jelena Rozga was born on 23 August 1977, to mother Marija Rozga, a tailor in the company Jugoplastika, and father Antonio Rozga in Split, a town in the region of Dalmatia, Croatia. Rozga has one older sister named Julija.[2] Rozga was a hyperactive and energetic child who often danced and performed in her house.[3] She insisted on becoming a ballet dancer and her parents sent her to ballet classes during the first grade of primary school when she was seven years old.[4][5] She joined KUD Mozaik where she was under the guidance of Lepa Smoje, a famous Croatian choreographer.[6] As a ballet dancer, she participated in various Yugoslav competitions. At the age of 13, Rozga was invited to participate in the opera house La Scala in Milan. Her parents, who could not afford moving abroad, could not let her participate.[7] During her teenage years, Rozga first joined the high school in Split and after deciding to pursue her passion for dancing, she auditioned to join the ballet ensemble of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. She was accepted by the commission which was amazed by her dancing talents. Together with the group, she started performing in various localized productions of the plays Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker among others.[4] Rozga later revealed that the ballet classes she did as a child "shaped me as a woman [...] it gave me order, dedication and discipline in life".[5]

During an interview for the Croatian TV channel Croatian Music Channel, Rozga revealed that even as a ballet dancer in her childhood, she had a big passion for singing and her dream, if she were ever to venture in a music career, would be to join Croatian pop band Magazin, whose lead singer at that time, Ljiljana Nikolovska, served as a source of inspiration for her. Rozga was also an avid fan of the band, whose songs she knew by heart.[4] In 1992, Rozga received an award at a singing competition where she performed the song "Uvenut će ružmarin" (English: The Rosemary Will Wither) by Magazin.[8] In 1994, she participated in another competition, Zvuci Jadrana (English: Sounds of the Adriatic), where she received the award Zlatna Gospa for best performance for her rendition of Magazin's "Ti si želja mog života" (English: You Are the Desire of My Life).[9]

When Rozga was at the age of 18, her mother who saw that Magazin's lead singer at that time, Danijela Martinović, was leaving the group, contacted group leader Tonči Huljić, informing him about her daughter's interest in auditioning for the group.[7] Rozga's mother also gave Huljić a picture of her daughter and home cassettes with audio recordings of her home performances.[10] Even before hearing her sing, Huljić decided to contract Rozga based on how "powerful" and unusual her surname sounded.[10][11] He traveled to Split where Rozga auditioned for five minutes, performing "only a song and a half", including "Opusti se" (English: Relax) and "Zlato ljubavi" (English: My Dear Love).[7] Shortly after hearing her sing, Tonči Huljić worked on "Aha" together with his wife, Vjekoslava Huljić, which was the first song Rozga had ever recorded.[4] Subsequently, Rozga stopped her ballet classes and embarked on her musical career in the group Magazin.[12][4] In 1996, she performed "Aha" on Dora, the Croatian song contest for Eurovision that year, where she finished second.[2] For the performance of the song, she appeared dressed as a ballerina and performed a dance choreography.[13]

That same year, at the age of 18, she signed a deal with Tonika Records, thus succeeding Danijela Martinović as the lead singer of Magazin. The first song she recorded with the group was "Suze Biserne" which the band also performed at the 1996 Melodije hrvatskog Jadrana [hr]. The song instantly became popular among fans of the group and at the 1996 Melodije hrvatskog Jadrana, it was recognized as the most performed song of the year.[2][14] In 1996, Magazin released their first album together with Rozga, and their twelfth overall studio album titled Nebo boje moje ljubavi. The album was a big commercial success receiving a golden certification in Croatia.[14] It produced several hit songs, including the widely famous singles "Suze Biserne", "Opijum" and "Minut' srca tvog" as well as "Nebo boje moje ljubavi" and "Samo navika". In 1997, Magazin competed at Dora with the song "Opijum", finishing seventh.[15] Several months after, the band also participated at the Melodijama Hrvatskog Jadrana (MHJ) where they performed the song "Ime mi spominje".[16] In 1998, the group's second studio album with Rozga, Da si ti ja was released; it was a commercial success in the region of former Yugoslavia, receiving a platinum certification in Croatia and Slovenia. The album produced several commercially successful singles, including "Gutljaj vina", "Ginem", "Na svijetu sve" and "Idi i ne budi ljude". The songs nevertheless were not well received by music critics due to their "easy" and simple lyrics.[17]

In 1999, Magazin performed at Dora with the song "Kasno je" and at the MHJ '99, they performed "Ako poludim". Minus i plus, the band's third album with Rozga, was released in 2000 and also included a streak of commercially successful singles such as the title song, "Je l' zbog nje", "Nemam snage da se pomirim" and "Ako poludim". The band performed "Hrvatska rapsodija" from the album at the 2000 Dora Festival and then "Nemam snage da se pomirim" at the Runjićev Festival.[18] The fourth studio album S druge strane mjeseca saw the release of several singles including the eponymous song, "Ko me zove?" and "Ne vjerujem tebi, ne vjerujem sebi"; the last was performed at the MHJ '02. The band also performed for the first time at the 2002 festival Zlatne žice Slavonije with the song "Hajde, kaži kako".[18]

The last album Magazin released with Rozga was  Paa..? and it included the hit singles "Ne tiče me se", "Troši i uživaj", "Kad bi bio blizu", "Da li znaš da te ne volim" and "Slatko, ljuto, kiselo".[5] In promotion of the album, the band performed "Kad bi bio blizu" at the 2003 Radijski festival and "Da li znaš da te ne volim" at the Split Festival. In 2004, the band won at the Split Music Festival with the song "Ne tiče me se" and performed at the Zlatne žice Slavonije festival with the song "Često".[18] The band competed at the Dora 2005 with the Biblical-themed song "Nazaret" featuring Ervin, placing second.[19][20] In 2006, Rozga left the group, after having been the lead singer for ten years. She continued collaborating with Tonči Huljić, the founder of the band.[21]

Rozga recorded and released her debut solo album Oprosti Mala in 2006; the album was a commercial success reaching the top of the Croatian Albums Chart. That same year, she performed the album's title song featuring Magazin at the 2006 Dora national festival which marked her debut solo performance. Oprosti Mala produced six singles including "Oprosti mala", "Ne zovi me Marija, "Ja znam dobro što mi je", "Sve se meni čini da", "Nemam" and "Gospe moja". In 2006, Rozga took part in the Dora national song festival with "Ne zovi me Marija" which finished 6th. Rozga performed "Gospe moja" at the 2007 Split Festival where the song also received the Grand Prix award.[5]

During interviews, Rozga revealed that the transition from Magazin to a solo career was a challenging and difficult period that caused a lot of stress and health problems. She revealed that she was unaware of all the responsibilities and independent decisions a solo career would bring along and experienced disappointment when some of her initial concerts were attended by small audiences.[1] Huljić also revealed that the initial period of transition involved searching for the sound the audience expected of Rozga and that it took almost four years before they could find her sound.[22]

Rozga's career rapidly moved upwards, especially in 2008 when she received the Grand Prix at the Split Music Festival for having the most played song from the previous year's festival's edition for "Gospe moja". She then released single "Daj šta daš" which topped charts both in Croatia and other neighbouring countries.

Rozga's music is generally classified as pop. Her earlier music records were heavily influenced by and contained Mediterranean and traditional music elements. Her music projects from the 2010s onwards incorporate more traditional regional musical styles, such as folk and turbo-folk elements which can be further classified in a genre dubbed "Croatian neofolk".[129] While her first two studio albums, Oprosti Mala and Bižuterija were more consistent genre-wise, Rozga's third studio album, Moderna žena, experimented with several musical genres, including mainstream music, electronic dance music (EDM), Dalmatian traditional music, pop balladry and rap.[63] Rozga cited Magazin singer Ljiljana Nikolovska as her biggest musical inspiration and the main reason she decided to venture in the music industry. Rozga was credited for bringing back the popularity to the group Magazin to a level similar to the period when Nikolovska was the lead singer of the band.

The lyrics of Rozga's song, which are frequently written by Vjekoslava Huljić, revolve around female experiences with love, betrayal, independence, heartbreak and female empowerement.[83][63] The lyrics of her most famous song "Bižuterija", describe the experience of a dissatisfied woman who is left by her partner after having been treated as "bijouterie".[130] The lyrics "žena, majka, kraljica" ("a woman, a mother, a queen") from the song "Bižuterija" became a catchphrase among the public on the Balkans, used to describe a powerful woman who can easily solve life problems. It also gained widespread use as a phrase of support and empowerment among women and as such, was used in merchandise.[13][131]

In addition to her musical legacy, she has become renowned for her fashion style recognizable by mini-skirts and high platform heels which were coined "Rozgice".[13] The singer describes her private fashion style as very different from her performance outfits as it consists primarily of jeans and shoes.[132] Critics often compliment the singer's fashion styles, which they view as fitting with her slim figure that she managed to maintain throughout the years.[133] She is also seen as a symbol of elegance and positive and lively energy.[12] Rozga's music and live performances have inspired singer Lorena Bućan, who has also named her her favorite singer in Croatia.[134] In May 2022, Rozga posted an Instagram video of the two singing Lorena's song "Tvoja i Gotovo".[135]

During her solo career, Rozga has received numerous awards for both her songs and albums.
