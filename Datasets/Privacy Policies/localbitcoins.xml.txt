Trading
Buying bitcoins

When a user buying bitcoins with traditional electronic payment methods using the escrow service, the buyer is required to provide correct reference message when paying. Bitcoin sellers are not required to release bitcoins paid with an incorrect reference. This is to prevent fraud.

Buyer should be ready to prove his/her identity, when buying bitcoins online and the payment method is reversible.
Accounts

An user can only act on his own behalf. No LocalBitcoins.com account can be used to act as an intermediary or broker. A user can only use his own trading accounts to trade at LocalBitcoins.com. A user account must not contain misleading information about the user, including, but not limited to having non-personal phone number or faking the country of origin.
Communication

Hate-speech and abusive language is strictly forbidden on LocalBitcoins.com. Any user account that engages in abusive language or hate-speech can be banned.
